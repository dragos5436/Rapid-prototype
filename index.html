        Krystal Marie Peterson (n√©e Harris; November 7, 1981, in Anderson, Indiana) is a singer-songwriter/instrumentalist who primarily plays the piano. Krystal has been singing since she was just 18 months old, and began playing the piano at 3 years of age. She also plays the drums and the flute. She graduated in 1999 from Anderson High School in Anderson, Indiana at the age of 17.
        <br>
        As early as 2000, she felt at odds with the demands of pop stardom. Krystal eventually moved back home to Indiana for what she called "a time of restoration" and to reassess her career. She married Daniel Peterson and they settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. Peterson is the drummer in Krystal's current band.
